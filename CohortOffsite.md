- The Deliberative Canvas - Enables importing of qualitative data from deliberative tools onto a digital canvas for dynamic data visualizations - enhancing deliberative processes via human exploration and discovery of (hidden) patterns/relationships.
- [CSV Interoperable Exports/Imports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x2crxfqU7hsnF1G_FQeDCvwlKctsW--wdA28ucd1KIc/edit) - CSV interoperable exports/imports for participatory objects like Assemblies, Meetings, Debates, Initiatives, Proposals and Participatory texts on the Decidim platform

Pairwise is an open-source, off-chain voting dapp (like Snapshot) that streamlines community signaling by letting users select between just two options and then aggregating their choices into a quantifiable result.
- Second Dimension - Project exploring the application of AI-powered systems to support collaborative investigations, harnessing the power of collective intelligence in high-stakes environments to collectively solve problems.
- [Ize](https://ize.space/) - Ize is a collective attention and action platform. Ize allows groups to co-create and evolve collaborative workflows that span across tools, organizational boundaries, and online identities. 
- [Harmonica](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dk1uHp_GxQWwb7ICmTe-yMXV47r3PQ77sZ5mgCeohG4/edit) - AI-powered chatbot that streamlines group deliberation by synthesizing opinions submitted through 1:1 dialogues into predictable output. https://harmonica.chat/
